# Kubernetes Cluster Setup and Application Deployment

## Overview

This project involves setting up an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with specific requirements and deploying two services (Service A and Service B) with an Ingress controller. The setup is automated and designed to be production-ready, with specific guidelines for ensuring the cluster is reliable and maintainable.

## Task Description
    - Create a Kubernetes cluster with the following:
    - **Service A:** Retrieves Bitcoin value in USD from an API every minute and prints it. Additionally, it calculates and prints the average value of the last 10 minutes every 10 minutes.
    - **Service B:** Prints "Hello Microsoft!" or maintains default behavior.
    - Deploy an Ingress controller to redirect traffic to the appropriate service based on the URL path (`/service-a` or `/service-b`).
    - Implement a network policy to ensure Service A cannot communicate with Service B.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Azure Setup
- **Create an Azure Account:** [Azure Sign Up](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

### 2. Run `setup-aks.ps1` Script

The `setup-aks.ps1` script automates the setup of the AKS cluster, configures the Ingress controller, and deploys the necessary resources.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure you have Azure CLI (`az`) and `kubectl` installed.
- Update the script with your Service Principal credentials and other necessary details.

**Steps:**

1. **Login to Azure:**
   ```powershell
   az login
   ```

2. **Set Azure Subscription:**
   ```powershell
   az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup-aks.ps1
   ```


### 3. Access the Services

After running the script, you can access your services using the Ingress IP:

- **Service A URL:** `http://<ingress-ip>/service-a`
- **Service B URL:** `http://<ingress-ip>/service-b`
